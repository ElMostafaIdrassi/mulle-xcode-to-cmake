# mulle-xcode-settings

A little tool to set Xcode build settings from the command line.

You can specify the target and the configuration to set. If you don't
specify a target, the setting is changed in the project. If you don't
specify a configuration, the setting will be applied to all configurations.

Therefore  specify a target and a configuration only changes the setting in
that target for that configuration.
